#### Summary

State is data representing the current condition of the app/component. When the state changes, the UI is re-built to match the updated state.

There are 2 types of state.

- Local state
- Global state

##### Local State

Local state is the internal state of a component. It can be managed by using the [`useState()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) hook.

##### Global State

Global state is state distributed across the entire application. It can be managed by in-built mechanisms like the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) or with libraries such as [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/react-integration.html), [Hookstate](https://hookstate.js.org), [Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.vercel.app) and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org).
